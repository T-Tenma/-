Depato announce 'Osechi-ryori' to be eaten on the next New Year

Depato announced 'Osechi-ryori' to be eaten in the next New Year. This year, there is a lot of Osechi-ryori that everyone can enjoy from small children to the elderly.
Takashimaya sell Osechi-ryori that are easy to eat for the elderly, such as Kamaboko which is soft as a bubble. There are also Osechi-ryori dishes which are made without things such as wheat and eggs, so that even children with allergies are able to eat them.
The Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Store sell Osechi-ryori in half-portions, for the elderly who are unable to eat a lot. They also have Osechi-ryori for students taking entrance-examinations and so on.
Osechi-ryori reservations begin in-store and online later this month. A research agency say that sales of Osechi-ryori are increasing every year, and on this year's New Year ¥60 billion worth was sold.
