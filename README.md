高岛屋出售一种将鱼糕软化为泡状，方便老年人食用的节年菜。为了让食物过敏的孩子也可以食用，推出了一种不加鸡蛋和小麦的节年菜。

有些老年人食量不大，大丸松坂屋百货店为此出售一种分量只有一半的节年菜。也有专为入学考试的学生准备的节年菜。

本月下旬开始可以在任意百货商店和网上预约节年菜。调查公司称每年的节年菜的销售额都在增加，今年正月份的销售额为600亿日元。

"Fire alarms in the house: 'Check if they sound correctly'"
Fire alarms are an appliance that sense smoke and heat and produce a sound to notify (you) of a fire. It has been over 10 years since it became a law (that you) are required to have one installed in the house.
According to the National Life Center, there have been 141 fire alarm incidents in the past 5 years, (with reports) such as "the sound won't stop". (<--iffy about this sentence) In an online questionnaire, 13% of people answered that "Although there was a fire, the fire alarm did not go off" or "The fire alarm sounded even though there was no fire".
The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said that in 91 fire cases last year, the fire alarms did not sound properly. It appeared that the causes were dead batteries and debris getting into (the fire alarm units).
The National Life Center says, "Fire alarms can easily break after about 10 years, (so) please check the fire alarms once in a while to ensure they sound correctly when there is a fire."

"在房间里的火灾报警器：检查一下他们是否听起来是正确的"
火灾报警器是一种能感知烟雾和热量的装置，它能发出一种声音来通知(你)火灾。从它成为一个要求你必须安装一个在房子里的法律已经超过10年了。
据国家生活中心报道，在过去的5年里发生了141起火灾报警事件(有报道)，比如声音不会停止。(<--不确定这句话)在一个在线调查问卷中，13%的人回答说“尽管发生了火灾，但是警报并没有响”或者“尽管警报响了，但是并没有发生火灾”。
火灾和灾害管理局说在去年的91一起火灾中，火灾警报的声音不太恰当。发生此事的原因是废弃电池及碎片掉落进入(火灾报警器)。
国家生活中心说，“火灾报警器在大概10年后就很容易故障，（因此）请偶尔检查一下火灾报警器以确保当火灾发生时能正确的报警。”

家中的火灾报警器：请检查其能否正常发声
火灾报警器是一种利用传感器检测到建筑物中的烟雾和热量之后，发出声音提示火灾的一种器械。法律规定必须在家中安装这种装置已经经过了10年。
根据国民生活中心的消息，近5年关于警报声无法停止的报告至今为止有141例。根据一项互联网的调查，有13%的人称“发生火灾时报警器没有发声”或者“明明没有发生火灾，报警器却发声了”。
总务省消防厅称去年发生的火灾中，有91起报警器没有正常报警发出声音。有的是因为电池没电了，有的是细小的垃圾进入了报警器。
国民生活中心称，火灾报警器使用10年左右后非常容易发生故障。为了使其在发生火灾时能够正常发声报警，请时常对其进行检查。

"Apple Introduces the New iPhone"
It's been 10 years since Apple first revealed the iPhone in 2007. On September 12th, Apple announced 3 new iPhones, including the 10th anniversary "iPhone X". 
The "iPhone X" no longer has the home button, which until now, was located below the screen. Instead of pushing a home button, you swipe your finger from the bottom of the screen upwards. To ensure no one else can use your phone, you can use the camera's facial recognition to unlock it. The iPhone will begin selling on November 3rd with a price of more than ￥100,000. (~$1000 USD)
Apple has released a new iPhone almost every year since it's initial release in 2007, and its popularity in the world is increasing. In Japan, half of all smartphone users have an iPhone.

Prices rise as bad weather continues
In Northeast Japan, Easter Hokkaido and Kanto, rainy and cloudy days, along with low temperatures have continued since late July. For this reason cucumber, tomato and other vegetable harvest are running late.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced the prices of five vegetables after checking with 470 grocery stores.
Cucumbers rose by 19 percent week over week. Tomatoes were up 12 percent. Both were above the yearly average by over 10 percent. Cabbage is up 26 percent week over week and 4 percent over the yearly average.
Lettuce and onions were up compared to the week prior but remain lower than the annual average.
MAFF expects prices to remain high until late August even if the weather improves.

The only survivor of a shipwreck was washed up on a small uninhabited island. He prayed feverishly for God to rescue him, and every day he scanned the horizon for help, but none seemed forthcoming.
Exhausted, he eventually managed to build a little hut out of driftwood to protect him from the elements, and to store his few possessions.
But then one day, after scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his little hut in flames, the smoke rolling up to the sky.
The worst had happened; everything was lost. He was stunned with grief and anger.  "God how could you do this to me!" he cried.
Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the sound of a ship that was approaching the island. It had come to rescue him. "How did you know I was here?"  asked the weary man of his rescuers. "We saw your smoke signal," they replied.
It is easy to get discouraged when things are going bad. But we shouldn't lose heart, because God is at work in our lives, even in the midst of pain and suffering.
Remember, next time your little hut is burning to the ground it just may be a smoke signal that summons the grace of God. For all the negative things we have to say to ourselves, God has a positive answer for it.

#### 译文
在海难中唯一的幸存者被冲上了一个无人居住的小岛上。他狂热的祈祷上帝拯救他，每天他都在地平线上寻求帮助，但似乎没有人来。最终，他精疲力尽的以浮木建立了一个小屋用以从恶劣的天气中保护他，并且存储他仅有的财产。
但是有一天，在寻找食物后，他发现他的小屋着火了，浓烟滚滚升上天空。
最坏的事情发生了，一切都失去了。他因为悲伤和愤怒都惊呆了。他哭着说“上帝，你怎么能这样对我！”。
然而，第二天早上，他被靠近小岛的轮船的声音吵醒，这艘船是来救他的。“你怎么知道我在这里？”那个疲惫的人问他的营救者。“我们看到了你的烟雾信号”他们回答。
事情变糟时很容易感到气馁。即使是在痛苦和苦难中，但是我们不应该失去信心，因为上帝在我们的生活中工作。
记住，下次你的小屋被烧成灰烬的时候，这也许只是一个烟的信号，召唤上帝的恩典。对于所有对于我们来说是消极的事情，上帝都有一个积极的答案。

#### 参考译文
在一场船难中，唯一的生存者随着潮水，漂流到一座无人岛上。他天天激动地祈祷神救他能够早日离开此处，回到家乡。 他还每天注视着海上有否可搭救他的人，但却是除了汪洋一片， 什么也没有。 
后来，他决定用那片带他到小岛的木头造一个简陋的小木屋，以保护他在这险恶的环境中生存，并且保存他所有剩下的东西。 
但有一天，在他捕完食物后，准备回小屋时， 突然发现他的小屋竟然陷在熊熊烈火之中， 大火引起的浓烟不断向天上窜。 
最悲惨的是：他所有的一切东西，在这一瞬间通通化为乌有了。 悲痛的他，气愤的对天吶喊着：神啊！你怎么可以这样对待我！顿时，眼泪从他的眼角中流出。 
第二天一早，他被一艘正靠近小岛的船只的鸣笛声所吵醒。 是的，有人来救他了。到了船上时，他问那些船员说： 「你怎么知道我在这里？」 因为我们看到了信号般的浓烟。」他们回答说。
人在碰到困难时，很容易会沮丧。 不过无论受到折磨或者痛苦，都不用因此失去信心， 因为上帝一直在我们心里面做着奇妙的工作。 
记住：当下一次你的小木屋着火时， 那可能只是上帝美妙恩典的表征而已。 在所有我们所认为负面的事情， 上帝都是有正面答案的。

"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."
“一点不错，”狐狸说。“对我来说，你还只是一个小男孩，就像其他千万个小男孩一样。我不需要你。你也同样用不着我。对你来说，我也不过是一只狐狸，和其他千万只狐狸一样。但是，如果你驯服了我，我们就互相不可缺少了。对我来说，你就是世界上唯一的了；我对你来说，也是世界上唯一的了。”

What makes you respect another person?
什么使你尊重他人？
1.They Dress Well - I’m not someone to judge someone for a brand they wear, but I do take notice of a guy or gal who consistently looks fly. My dad used to tell me to dress for the job I desire, not the job I have. I think that applies here.
他们打扮的好——我不是以穿着评价他人的人，但是一个男的或者一个女的总是看起来像苍蝇会引起我的注意。我父亲曾告诉我为我想要的工作打扮，而不是为我拥有的工作打扮。我认为这里非常适用。
2.They’re in Good Shape - It’s really difficult to hit the gym or go for a run following a long day at work. That’s why I have profound respect for individuals who are disciplined and keep themselves in great shape.
他们形象很好——在漫长的一天工作后，去健身房锻炼身体或者进行一次跑步是非常困难的。这就是为什么我对有规律保持自己形象的人具有深深的敬意。
3.They Smile/Greet Strangers - Strangers can quickly become acquaintances, friends and potentially even more. I respect people who go out of their way to acknowledge strangers in a positive manner!
他们对陌生人微笑/问候——陌生人可以很快的成为熟人、朋友甚至更多。我尊敬那些那些出门在外以积极态度去认识陌生人的人。
4.They’re Honest - I have profound respect for those people who I can tell something to and trust that they won’t pass that information on without my consent.
他们的诚实——我深深尊重那些我能告诉他们并相信他们不会在我未征得我同意的情况下通过这些信息的人。
5.They Work Their Tail Off - There are people with super high motors that seem to constantly be driven to achieve something new. These individuals receive tremendous respect from me.
他们努力工作——有些人拥有超高的马达，似乎总是被驱使着去完成一些新的事情。这些人受到我的极大尊重。
6.They Pay it Forward - I respect those who have been blessed financially and contribute a good portion of their wealth back into society.
他们让爱传出去——我尊重那些取的巨大财富并将大部分回馈社会的人。
7.The Way They Treat Their Significant Other -When I see an older gentleman hold the door for his wife or pull out the chair for her when sitting down, it warms my heart and I immediately respect him on a whole new level.
他们对待自己的另一半的方式——当我看到一位年长的绅士为妻子开门，或是当她坐下来为她拉出椅子时，它温暖了我的心，我立刻对他的尊敬上升到一个新的阶段。
8.The Professional Position They Hold - If I meet the General Manager of the Houston Astros, I’m going to have respect for him because I’ve got a hunch of everything he’s gone through to get to where he’s at today.
他们所持的职业立场——如果我遇到了休斯顿太空人队的总经理，我将会尊重他，因为我有一种预感，他所经历的一切才到达他现在的位置。
9.They Say Something Unpopular Because it Needs to be Said - I’m sure many of you have that friend or family member that never hesitates to say something, despite the awkwardness. I love these people.
他们说一些不受欢迎的东西，因为它需要被说出来——我相信很多人都有这样的朋友或家人，他们从不犹豫地说些什么，尽管他们很尴尬。我爱这些人。
10.The way they treat service staff - So many people treat service industry workers like lesser humans. As if what they do is meaningless and mindless. And that could not be further from the truth. We all should be cognizant of the way we treat the lady working the cash register or the young man bagging our groceries…because it says a lot more about who we are than who they are!
他们对待服务人员的方式——很对人对待服务人员像对待下等人。好像他们所做的一切都毫无意思。这不可能是真的。我们都应该意识到我们对待收银员或者装货的年轻人……因为这更能说明我们是谁，而不是他们是谁！

1.穿着得体——我并非靠衣服的牌子看人，但的确会特别注意总是穿着时髦的男孩女孩。我爸爸过去告诉我：穿衣服，是为了得到你想得到的工作，而不是为现有的工作穿的，我觉得很有道理。


2.They’re in Good Shape - It’s really difficult to hit the gym or go for a run following a long day at work. That’s why I have profound respect for individuals who are disciplined and keep themselves in great shape.

2.身材好——一天长时间的工作之后很难再坚持去健身房或跑步，这就是为什么我十分尊重自律而且身材保持得好的人。


3.They Smile/Greet Strangers - Strangers can quickly become acquaintances, friends and potentially even more. I respect people who go out of their way to acknowledge strangers in a positive manner!

3.微笑/跟陌生人打招呼——陌生人很快就能变成熟人、朋友，甚至关系还能更进一步。我尊重那些不嫌麻烦、积极认识陌生人的人。

6.传递爱——我尊重那些运气好、很有钱、而且还会把一部分财富回馈给社会的人。

9.必要时会说不受欢迎的话——我确定很多人都有这样的朋友或家人，他们心直口快，即使有时难免尴尬，但我喜欢这样的人。

We all should be cognizant of the way we treat the lady working the cash register or the young man bagging our groceries…because it says a lot more about who we are than who they are!

10.对待服务员的态度——很多人觉得服务行业的人低人一等，好像他们所做的都是无意义的不用动脑的工作，这种态度真是大错特错。我们都应该注意自己对待收银台的女士、或者帮我们把东西装袋的年轻小伙的态度，因为我们的态度并非是在体现他们的人品，而是在很大程度上说明了我们自己是什么样的人。

“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.”

“这也是一种早已被人忘却了的事。”狐狸说，“它就是使某一天与其他日子不同，使某一时刻与其它时刻不同。比如说，我的那些猎人就有一种仪式。他们每星期四都和村子里的姑娘们跳舞。于是，星期四就是一个美好了日子！我可以一直散步到葡萄园去。如果猎人们什么时候都跳舞，天天又全都一样，那么我也就没有假日了。”

However, there always are some coincidences in people's lives, two parallel lines might join some day.　

但是， 人生总有许多巧合，两条平行线也可能会有交汇的一天。

　　
Dec.22. Cloudy with sunshine periods. The thick cloud still covers the top of the hills.

12月22日 太阳微微露脸，浓密的乌云仍堆挤在山顶。

Then, one day, they meet in front of the fountain in the park.　　
于是，有一天，他们在公园里的喷水池前相遇了。

It was many years ago. 
I was a young dad sitting on the couch
reading a fairy tale to my little girl. 
She sat next to me with her head on my arm 
as I told the tale. 
When it came to the end I finished 
with those famous words:
 'And they lived happily ever after.' 
As I looked over to her with her wavy, brown hair 
and big, innocent eyes 
I could see the smile on her face 
and I never wanted it to end. 
It dawned on me then that the ending of the book 
was what I wanted for her.
I wanted her to 'live happily ever after.
Still, deep in my heart 
I knew that this couldn't always be so. 
I knew that there would be times 
when her heart was broken.
 I knew there would be times 
when she cried in grief and I couldn't comfort her. 
I knew there would be times 
when all she felt 
was fear, sadness, sorrow, and despair. 
As I stroked her hair and smiled at her 
I hoped that those times would be brief 
and that she would have joy in her life more often than not. 
Living happily ever after, 
though
seemed out of the question.
It took me a lot of years to realize 
that it IS possible to live happily ever after. 
You just have to do it 'one day at a time.' 
Happiness you see isn't some reward 
hat you get at the end of your journey.
 Happiness isn't something dependent 
on what life hands you. 
Happiness is something you create in your life 
choice by choice 
and day by day.
The truth is happiness comes when you love. 
Love is a gift from God.
It is love that mends broken hearts.
It is love that heals grief. 
It is love that gives us joy. 
Choose to 'live happily ever after, 
one day at a time.'

那是很多年以前。
我还是一个年轻的父亲，当时我坐在沙发上正在给我的小女孩读一个童话故事。
她坐在我旁边，头靠着我的手臂上,就像我故事里说的那样。
当故事到结尾部分时，我用那句著名的“从此以后，他们过上了幸福的生活”结束了整个故事。
当我看着她的卷发，棕色的头发和又大又无辜的眼睛，我可以看到她脸上的笑容，我希望时光永远的停在这一刻。
它让我明白了，那本书的结局就是我想给她的。
我想让她“从此过上幸福的生活”。
不过，在我内心深处知道事情不会总是如此。
我知道有时她会伤心。
我知道有时她会悲伤地哭泣，而我无法安慰她。
我知道有时她会感到恐惧、悲伤、遗憾和绝望。
我抚摸着她的头发，对她微笑，我希望那些时间都是短暂的，而且她在生活中有更多的快乐。
从此过上幸福的生活，虽然，这似乎是不可能的。
我花了很多年才意识到从此过上幸福的生活是可能的。
你仅仅需要随其自然。
幸福并不是什么奖励，而是在旅途终点得到的一顶帽子。
幸福并不是依赖于生活给予你的。
幸福是你在生活中创造的某样东西，选择再选择，日复一日。
事实上当你爱的时候幸福就悄然来临。
爱是上帝赐予的礼物。
是爱修复了破碎的心灵。
是爱治愈了悲伤。
是爱给予我们快乐。
选择从此过上幸福的生活，随其自然。

I could see the smile on her face

我看着她

她有着卷曲的棕色头发

和大大的、天真的眼睛

我能从她的脸上看到微笑

我希望能永远这样看着她


It dawned on me then that the ending of the book 

was what I wanted for her.

I wanted her to 'live happily ever after.'

那时我明白了故事的结尾也是我对她的期望

hat you get at the end of your journey.

你看到的幸福

并非你人生旅程最终的奖励

而是你日复一日通过一个个选择

在生活中创造出来的。


The truth is happiness comes when you love. 

Love is a gift from God.

事实是幸福就是付出爱时的体验，

爱是上帝恩赐的礼物。


It is love that mends broken hearts.

It is love that heals grief. 

It is love that gives us joy. 

只有爱才能修复受伤的心灵

只有爱才能抚平伤痛

只有爱才能给我们带来快乐


Choose to 'live happily ever after, 

one day at a time.'

选择“从此过上幸福的生活，

过好每一天。”

Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.

Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite of what's next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long as you are young.

When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.

#### 译文
青春不是人生的一段时间，而是一种精神状态。青春不是桃面、丹唇、柔膝，而是深沉的意志、丰富的想象、炽热的感情。青春是生命的深泉在涌动。

青春意味着战胜怯懦的勇气，意味着对冒险的渴望胜过对安逸的热爱。这些通常更多的存在于60岁的男人身上而不是20岁的男孩。没有人仅仅因年龄的增长而变老。

岁月流逝只令容颜苍老，激情不再却使心灵枯萎。忧虑，恐惧，缺乏自信会使心灵扭曲，使精神蒙尘。

无论是60或者是16，每个人的心中都有来自奇迹的诱惑，孩童般天真的对未来的渴望和生活的乐趣。在你我心中都有一个无线站：只要从年轻人那里接受美好、希望、欢乐、勇气和力量的信号，你就保持青春。

当天线降下来，你的精神被玩世不恭和悲观厌世的冰雪覆盖，那么你就老了，尽管你在20岁，但只要你竖起天线，头接收乐观的电波，那么你有希望在80岁的时候英年早逝。

#### 参考译文
青春不是年华，而是心境；青春不是桃面、丹唇、柔膝，而是深沉的意志，恢宏的想象，炙热的感情；青春是生命的深泉在涌流。
青春气贯长虹，勇锐盖过怯弱，进取压倒苟安。如此锐气，二十后生而有之，六旬男子则更多见。年岁有加，并非垂老，理想丢弃，方堕暮年。
岁月悠悠，衰微只及肌肤；热忱抛却，颓废必致灵魂。忧烦，惶恐，丧失自信，定使心灵扭曲，意气如灰。
无论年届花甲，抑或二八芳龄，心中皆有生命之欢乐，奇迹之诱惑，孩童般天真久盛不衰。人人心中皆有一台天线，只要你从天上人间接受美好、希望、欢乐、勇气和力量的信号，你就青春永驻，风华常存。
一旦天线下降，锐气便被冰雪覆盖，玩世不恭、自暴自弃油然而生，即使年方二十，实已垂垂老矣；然则只要树起天线，捕捉乐观信号，你就有望在八十高龄告别尘寰时仍觉年轻。

Dear Helene,
亲爱的helene
I quite agree it is time we dropped the “Miss” when writing to you. I am not really so stand-offish as you may have been led to believe, but as copies of letters I have written to you go into the office files the formal address seemed more appropriate. But as this letter has nothing to do with books, there will be no copy.
我非常同意是时候给你写信了，我们删除了“MISS”。我并不像你可能相信的那样真的是那么的孤立无援，但是我给你写的信的副本都写进了办公室的文件，而正式的地址似乎更合适。但由于这封信与书无关，所以没有副本。
We are quite at a loss to know how you managed the nylons which appeared this noon as if by magic. All I can tell you is that when I came back from lunch they were on my desk with a note reading: “From Helene Hanff.” No one seems to know how or when they arrived. The girls are very thrilled and I believe they are planning to write to you themselves.
我们很茫然不知你们是如何管理今天中午出现的尼龙长袜，就像魔法一样。我能告诉你的是，午饭回来的时候他们在我的办公桌上有一纸条：“从Helene Hanff。”没人知道是如何是什么时候到的。女孩们非常激动，我相信她们正在计划给你写信。
I am sorry to say that our friend Mr. George Martin who has been so ill for some time passed away in hospital last week. He was with the firm a great number of years, so with that loss and the King dying so suddenly as well, we are rather a mournful crowd at the moment.
我很遗憾地说，我们的朋友乔治·马丁先生上个星期病得很重。他在这家公司呆了很多年，在这种损失下，国王也突然去世，所以我们现在是悲伤的人群。
I don’t see how we can ever repay you for your many kind gifts. All I can say is, if you ever decide to make the trip to England, there will be a bed for you at 37 Oakfield Court for as long as you care to stay.
我看不出我们怎样才能报答你的礼物。我能说得的是，如果你什么时候想来英国旅游了，只要你愿意留下，奥克菲尔德法院37号就会有一张床。

3 EXERCISES TO END BACK PAIN

IS YOUR BACK BOTHERING YOU? RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOVING MORE CAN BE THE BEST MEDICINE. HERE ARE 3 WAYS TO SEND YOUR BACK PAIN PACKING.

1. Stretching
The proof: A recent study found that stretching is just as effective as yoga at decreasing back-pain.
Why it works: Stretching of any kind, whether static (you hold the pose) or dynamic (you move through a complete range of motion), can help improve flexibility and decrease back-pain risk and symptoms.
Try this move: Half Lunge (stretches hips, calves)
Stand with feet staggered, left leg in front. Bend your front knee about 90 degrees and lower your back knee a few inches from the floor. Press your right hip forward, feeling a stretch along the front of your hip. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Switch sides.

2.Yoga
The proof: Two recently published studies found that people who practiced yoga had less back pain and more mobility than people who did other sports.
Why it works: Yoga combines stretching with strength and balance poses, which helps shore up weak muscles and release tight ones. It’s also a stress reliever; tension can lead to a tight back.
Try this move: Child’s Pose (stretches back; improves relaxation)
Sit on heels, knees hip-distance apart. Exhale and lower torso between thighs. Reach arms forward. Hold for about 30 to 60 seconds.

3. Strength Training
The proof: Physical therapists have long advocated doing traditional resistance training (using body weight only, bands, dumbbells, or machines) to improve strength and regain function, especially for everyday activities.
Why it works: It stabilizes and strengthens your entire body. “Back pain can occur when muscles are not prepared for a certain movement, whether that’s lifting a heavy box or carrying a child,” says A. Lynn Millar, PT, PhD, a professor of physical therapy at Winston-Salem State University.
Try this move:Body Squat (strengthens legs, glutes, core)
Stand with feet hip-distance apart. Bend knees, shifting hips back as if sitting into a chair, and lift arms. Hold for 1 count; return to start. Do 10 to 15 reps.

3种运动结束背部疼痛
你的背部困扰着你吗？研究表明多运动就是最好的药。这里有3中方法可以帮你减轻疼痛。

1.拉伸
证据：最近的一个研究发现伸展运动于减轻背痛和瑜伽一样有效。
原因：无论是什么样的拉伸，是静止的（保持姿势）还是动态的（通过这种各样的动作）都可以帮助提高柔韧性，以及减少背痛的风险和症状。
试试这个动作：班弓步（拉伸臀部和小腿）双脚交叉站立，左腿在前，弯曲前膝大约90°并降低你后面的那条腿到离地面大约几英尺。将右髋向前，感觉髋关节前部的拉伸。保持20到30秒，交换。

2.瑜伽
证明：最近两项已发表的研究发现，练习瑜伽的人比联系其他运动的人更少的患有背痛以及更高的柔韧性。
原因：瑜伽将力量和平衡结合为拉伸，有助于支撑虚弱的肌肉和放松紧绷的肌肉。这也是一种缓解压力的方式，紧张会导致紧绷。
试试这个动作：儿童姿势（向后伸展；慢慢放松）坐在脚跟，膝盖与臀部分开。呼气，让身体在大腿间慢慢下沉。手臂向前，保持30到60秒。

3.力量训练
证明：物理治疗师一直提倡做传统阻力训练（只用体重带，哑铃，或机器）提高力量和恢复能力，尤其是在日常活动中。
原因：它稳定和加强你的整个身体。温斯顿塞勒姆州立大学物理治疗学教授A博士说:“当肌肉没有为某种运动做好准备时，背部疼痛就会发生，无论是抬着一个沉重的箱子还是抱着一个小孩。”
试试这个动作：身体下蹲（增强腿部、臀部、核心）双脚分开站立。弯曲膝盖，向后移动臀部，就像坐在椅子上，举起手臂。坚持1个八拍，回到开始。重复10到15次。

I grew up in a small town where the elementary school was a ten-minute walk from my house and in an age not so long ago, when children could go home for lunch and find their mothers waiting.

At the time, I did not consider this a luxury, although today it certainly would be. I took it for granted that mothers were the sandwich-makers, the finger-painting appreciators and the homework monitors.

I never questioned that this ambitious, intelligent woman, who had had a career before I was born and would eventually return to a career, would spend almost every lunch hour throughout my elementary school years just with me.

I only knew that when the noon bell rang, I would race breathlessly home. My mother would be standing at the top of the stairs, smiling down at me with a look that suggested I was the only important thing she had on her mind.

For this, I am forever grateful. Some sounds bring it all back: the highpitched squeal of my mother's teakettle, the rumble of the washing machine in the basement and the jangle of my dog's license tags as she bounded down the stairs to greet me.

Our time together seemed devoid of the gerrymandered schedules that now pervade my life.


#### 译文
我在一个小镇上长大，那里的小学离我家有十分钟的路程，而在不久以前，孩子们可以回家吃午饭，发现他们的母亲在等着。
当时，我并不认为这是一种奢侈，尽管今天也不会。我想当然地认为妈妈们是做三明治的人，手指绘画鉴赏家和家庭作业监督者。
我从来没有怀疑过这个雄心勃勃、聪明的女人在我出生前就有了事业，将来还会回到职业生涯中，在我的小学阶段，几乎每一个午餐时间都和我在一起。
我只知道，当中午下课铃一响，我就气喘吁吁地跑回家。我的母亲会站在楼梯的顶端，面带微笑地看着我，这说明我是她心中唯一重要的东西。
对此，我永远心存感激。 一些声音将一切都带回来了：母亲的烧水壶的高音尖叫，在地下室下隆隆的洗衣机和我的狗的牌照的声音，她跳下楼来迎接我。
和母亲在一起的岁月所缺乏的那些事先安排充满了我现在的生活。

Hi! It's your body here! 
Allow me to reintroduce myself. 

I'm the home that you've always lived in. 
Surely you remember.
We grew up together!

And I'm writing in this letter cause, 
I feel neglected in this relationship,
very disappointed in what I've been seeing. 

With your ambition to make money 
you sacrificed my well being, 
which makes no sense in the least 
because when I get sick 
you sacrificed that same money 
to recuperate ME.
 
And what's even more ironic
is with all your interest in profit 
you can't even see the truth
that I'm worth over A BILLION DOLLARS.

Don't believe me?
Okay I'll prove it.
 
If someone came to you 
with a check for One Million 
and said “Here. 
All I want in return is your eyesight.”
 
You will never be able to see another sunset 
for the rest of your natural life. 
Would you take that deal?
 
Ok, let's up the bid.
 
Suppose he had a check for Ten Million instead, 
And if you accepted 
you would no longer have use of your arms or legs. 
Would you take THAT deal?
 
I can answer that for you. 
NO.

Those are silly options because you know that
as your body I am worth over a BILLION DOLLARS.
 
And don't get me started with the heart. 
If I was a company, right? 
This Heart wouldn't get Employee of the Month. 
It would get the Employee of the LIFE!
 
Because throughout your entire existence as a person, 
your heart never stops working! 

Even when you're sleeping 
it doesn't stop beating,
that's EVERY SECOND 
EVERY MINUTE 
EVERY DAY 
and come to think of it 
I can't recall you ever saying Thanks.

Anyway I don't want this to come off as rude. 
Just asking for a little attention here dude.
 
I know you try to make me look perfect 
when you're Instagramming. 
But we both know you been taking me for granted.

Consider this an opportunity. 
After this video ends 
don't click to the next one like you do usually. 

Take some time by yourself. 
Just, you and me. 
Place your hand on your chest 
and say “Thank You” to your heartbeat. 

To your EYES, LEGS, ARMS. 
To your hands that your use for climbing. 
To your lungs that bring you breathe 
without you even trying.  

I do it all for you, cause you come first.
Cause you're my homie! 
We go way back, don't we? 
Like, birth?

I just think it's time 
you start treating me what I'm worth.

(｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ嗨!这里是你的身体！让我再次介绍我自己。

我是你曾经居住过的家。当然你记得，我们一起成长。
我写这封信的原因是，我感觉我在这种关系中被忽视了，我对我所看到的感到非常失望。
随着你追求赚钱，你牺牲了我的健康，这是毫无意义的，因为当我生病的时候，你需要牺牲同样多的钱来使我恢复。
更讽刺的是你尽管对利润有兴趣，但是你甚至看不到真相，我的价值超过十亿美元。
不相信我？好，我会向你证明的。
如果有人拿着一百万的支票来找你并说：“我只想要你的视力”。
在你余生里，你将再也看不到日落了。你愿意接受那笔交易吗？
好，让我们出价吧。
假如他拥有一千万的支票，如果你接受了，你将再也不能使用你的胳膊或腿。你愿意接受那笔交易吗？
我可以为你回答
不！
这些都是愚蠢的选择，因为你知道，作为你的身体，我价值超过十亿美元。
不要让我从心脏开始。如果我是一家公司，对吧？心脏不会只被雇佣一个月，它将获得一辈子的雇佣。
因为在你整个生命中作为一个人，你的心永远不会停止工作。
尽管当你在睡觉的时候，他也不停止跳动，每一秒、每一分、每一天好好想想吧，我不记得你说过谢谢。
无论如何，我不想这件事变得粗鲁。只是要求你注意一下，伙计。
我知道你尽量让我看起来完美当你在instagram？但是我们都知道你一直认为我是理所当然？
假设这是一个机会，当这段视频结束后，不要像平常那样点击下一个。
给自己留些时间，仅仅你和我。把你的手放在胸部上，然后给你的心跳说“谢谢”。
对你的眼睛、腿、手臂、对你攀爬的手，对不用你任何尝试就带给你呼吸的肺部。
我为你作者一切，因为你先来。因为你是我的兄弟！我们要回去了，不是吗？
就像，出生。
我只是觉得现在是时候了，你开始探讨我的价值。

我对我所看到的很失望。

which makes no sense in the least

你有想挣钱的雄心，

却为此牺牲我的健康。

you can't even see the truth

that I'm worth over A BILLION DOLLARS.

甚至看不清这个事实：

我才是最宝贵的啊！ 


Don't believe me?

Okay I'll prove it.

你不相信？

好吧，我证明给你看。

with a check for One Million 

and said “Here. 

All I want in return is your eyesight.”

如果有人拿着100万的支票来找你，

我想要你的视觉。”

你将在余生里再也看不到夕阳，

这样的交易你愿意吗？

And if you accepted 

you would no longer have use of your arms or legs. 

Would you take THAT deal?

假设他有一张千万的支票，

如果你接受了，

你将再也无法使用四肢。

你要交换吗？

 

I can answer that for you. 

NO.

我可以替你回答。NO。


Those are silly options because you know that

as your body I am worth over a BILLION DOLLARS.

这都是一些很愚蠢的选择，

因为我的价值远不止于此。

 

And don't get me started with the heart. 

If I was a company, right? 

This Heart wouldn't get Employee of the Month. 

It would get the Employee of the LIFE!

别让我提心脏了。

如果我是一间公司，

心脏不会得到“月度最佳员工”称号。

它要得到的是“终身最佳员工”。

 

Because throughout your entire existence as a person, 

your heart never stops working! 

因为在你的一生里，

你的心脏从未停止工作！


Even when you're sleeping 

it doesn't stop beating,

that's EVERY SECOND 

EVERY MINUTE 

EVERY DAY 

and come to think of it 

I can't recall you ever saying Thanks.

即使在你睡觉时，

它也没有停止跳动，

每秒每分每天都在工作，

现在想想，

我不曾听你说过谢谢。


Anyway I don't want this to come off as rude. 

Just asking for a little attention here dude.

无论如何，

我不想冒犯你，

只是想要你对我多点关心。

 

I know you try to make me look perfect

But we both know you been taking me for granted.

我知道你发朋友圈时想让我尽量看起来完美。

但是我们都知道，

你并不重视我。


Consider this an opportunity.

借此机会，

看完这个视频，

别忙着像往常一样点下一个。


Take some time by yourself. 

Just, you and me. 

Place your hand on your chest 

and say “Thank You” to your heartbeat. 

给你和我一点独处的时间。

把你的手放在胸口，对心脏说“谢谢”。


To your EYES, LEGS, ARMS. 

To your hands that your use for climbing. 

To your lungs that bring you breathe 

without you even trying.  

对你的眼睛、双腿、胳膊，

对你用来攀爬的手，

对让你呼吸的肺部说“谢谢”。 


I do it all for you, cause you come first.

Cause you're my homie! 

We go way back, don't we? 

Like, birth?

我为你做这一切，

是因为你永远是我的第一位，

因为你是我的好朋友，

我们认识很久了，对吧？

大概，从出生开始？


I just think it's time 

you start treating me what I'm worth.

我想，

是时候你该给我应有的对待了。

Ready or not, some day it will all come to an end. There will be no more sunrises, no days, no hours or minutes.

All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to someone else.

Your wealth, fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance. It will not matter what you owned or what you were owed.

Your grudges, resentments, frustrations, and jealousies will finally disappear.

So, too, your hopes, ambitions, plans, and to-do lists will all expire.

The wins and losses that once seemed so important will fade away.

It won't matter where you came from, or on what side of the tracks you lived.

It won't matter whether you were beautiful or brilliant.Your gender, skin color, ethnicity will be irrelevant.

So what will matter?How will the value of your days be measured?

What will matter is not what you bought, but what you built;not what you got, but what you gave.

What will matter is not your success, but your significance.

What will matter is not what you learned, but what you taught.

What will matter is every act of integrity, compassion, courage and sacrifice that enriched, empowered or encouraged others to emulate your example.

What will matter is not your competence, but your character.

What will matter is not how many people you knew, but how many will feel a lasting loss whenyou re gone.

What will matter is not your memories, but the memories of those who loved you.

What will matter is how long you will be remembered, by whom and for what.

Living a life that matters doesn t happen by accident.

It's not a matter of circumstance but of choice.

Choose to live a life that matters.

#### 译文
无论你是否准备好，有一天一切都会结束，这里不再有日出，没有白天，没有小时，没有分钟。
你所收集的一切东西，不管是珍藏的还是遗忘的都会传给某人。
你的财富、名望和世俗的权利都将毫无用处，你曾经拥有什么或亏欠什么都已经无所谓了。
你的怨恨、愤慨、挫折和嫉妒最终都会消失。
同样的，你的希望、抱负、计划和代办事项都将到期。
曾经看起来如此重要的胜负逐渐消失。
你来自哪里，或者你生活在哪一方都无关紧要。
不管事漂亮还是聪明，你的性别、肤色、种族都无关紧要。
那么什么才是重要的呢？怎么计算你的日子的价值？
重要的不是你买的，而是你建造的；不是你得到的，而是你给予的。
重要的不是你的成功，而是你的意义。
重要的不是你学到的，而是你教的。
重要的是每一个正直、同情、勇气和牺牲的行为，都会丰富、授权或激励他人以你为榜样。
重要的不是你的能力，而是你的性格。
重要的不是你知道多少人，而是在你离去后有多少人觉得是一个损失。
重要的不是你的记忆，而是那些爱你的人的记忆。
重要的是你会被铭记多长时间，被谁，为什么。
过一种重要的生活不会是偶然发生的。
环境并不重要，重要的是选择。
选择过有意义的生活。

In 1899, when Einstein studied at the Swiss Federal University of Technology in Zurich, his tutor was Minkevsky, a mathematician.

Once Einstein asked Minkevsky, "How can a person, like me, leave his distinct footprints on the road of life and make an outstanding contribution in the scientific field?" It was a "sophisticated" problem. Minkevsky said that he had to think about it better and then gave him an answer.

Three days later, Minkevsky told Einstein that the answer was coming! He pulled Einstein to walk toward a building site and straight set foot on the cement ground that the construction workers had just paved.

In the workers' scolding, Einstein was confused to ask Minkevsky，"Sir, don't you lead me astray?"

"Right, exactly!" Minkevsky said. "Have you seen it? Only the old road surface that have long solidified and on those place that have been passed by countless steps, you cannot tread out your footprint.

Hearing that, Einstein thought long and nodded significantly, Since then, a very strong sense of innovation and pioneering consciousness began dominating Einstein's thinking and action. He said, "I never memorize and reflect what dictionaries and manuals carry, for my brain only memorize those things that are not included in books." It was such a reason that Einstein left his deep sparkling footprints in the history of science.

1899年当爱因斯坦就读于苏黎世联邦科技大学时，他的导师是明可夫斯基一个数学家。
有一次爱因斯坦问明可夫斯基：“像我这样一个人，怎样才能在人生的道路上留下自己独特的狙击，在科学领域中做出杰出贡献呢？”这是一个复杂的问题。明可夫斯基说他需要好好想想再给他答案。
三天后，明可夫斯基告诉爱因斯坦，答案就来了！他来着爱因斯坦走到一个建筑工地上，笔直地踩在建筑工人刚刚铺好的水泥地上。
在工人的责骂声中，爱因斯坦困惑的问明可夫斯基“先生，您这不是让我误入歧途吗？”
“当然，一定不会！”明可夫斯基说。“你看见没？只有那些长久固化的旧路面和那些通过无数的脚步的路，你不能留下你的足迹”。
听到这里，爱因斯坦想了很长时间，然后若有所思的点了点头，从此，一个非常强烈的创新和开拓的意识开始主导着爱因斯坦的思维和行动。他说“我从来不记忆和考虑字典和手册，我的大脑只能记住那些不包括在书本中的东西。”这就是为什么爱因斯坦在科学史上留下了他光辉的足迹。

I’m in my late twenties.

I used to get up at 12 o’clock in the afternoon and now 7 o’clock in the morning. I used to go to bed in the midnight and now 11 o’clock in the night.

I’m in my late twenties.

At work, I begin to contact different people.

I’m in my late twenties.

When you meet relatives and friends, they no longer ask you what scores you get in the school. Instead, they ask you how much money you make every month, and whether you are married or not.

I’m in my late twenties. 

Our chatting topics changed from online games to cars, houses.

When having dinner, we always talk about when is he or she getting married.

I’m in my late twenties.

I no longer complain about the numerous homework which can never be done. I begin to worry about the increasing gas price, house price, as well as the ups and downs of the stock market.

I’m in my late twenties.


I no longer splash my money. Instead, I start to manage my account at the end of each month. Making note of how much have I spent and how much is left after paying my credit card. It’s time to save some money for the house.


I’m in my late twenties.

I’m getting tired of hanging around bars and KTVs. Being close to nature and a healthy living style is my favorite now.

I’m in my late twenties.

Sometimes, I feel lonely, and sometimes, I miss someone.

I’m in my late twenties.

We start chasing our dreams. We hide our tears and we don’t give up for that little setback.

I’m in my late twenties.

We are no longer as wild as when we were young. We treat all the adversities as part of our life and we try to tolerate and to embrace this life.

我快30了。
我曾经常常在中午12点起床，而现在早上七点就起来了。我曾经常常在午夜睡觉，而现在晚上11点就休息了。
我快30了。
工作上，我开始联系各种不同的人员。
我快30了。
当你遇到亲戚朋友时，他们再也不问你在学校取的什么样的分数。相反，他们问你每月薪水多少，还有你是否结婚。
我快30了。
我们的话题从线上游戏转变成车、房。
当我们吃晚饭时，我们总是讨论他或者她什么时候结婚。
我快30了。
我不再抱怨大量做不完的作业。我开始担心天然气价格上涨，房价上涨以及股市涨跌。
我快30了。
我不再浪费我的钱。相反我开始在每个月末管理我的账户。记下每笔花费以及还了信用卡后还剩有多少。是时候为房子存一点钱了。
我快30了。
我已经厌倦了酒吧、KTV。我现在最喜欢的是亲近自然和一个健康的生活方式。
我快30了。
有时候，我感觉孤独，有时候，我想念某人。
我快30了。
我们开始追逐我们的梦想。我们隐藏了我们的眼泪，我们不会为了小小的挫折而放弃。
我快30了。
我不在如我年轻时那样疯狂了。我们把所有的逆境当作我们生活的一部分，我们试图容忍和拥抱这个生活。

Just for today I will try to live through this day only and not tackle my whole life problem at once. I can do something for twelve hours that would appal me if I had to keep it up for a lifetime.
Just for today I will be happy. This assumes to be true what Abraham Lincoln said, that “Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.”
Just for today I will adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my “luck” as it comes.
Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.
Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways. I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out: If anybody knows of it, it will not count. I will do at least two things I don’t want to do—just for exercise. I will not show anyone that my feelings are hurt: they may be hurt, but today I will not show it.
Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress becomingly, talk low, act courteously, criticize not one bit, and try not to improve or regulate anybody but myself.
Just for today I will have a program, I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.
Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.
Just for today I will be unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful, and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.

只为了今天，我将试着只活在今天，而不是立刻解决终身问题。对于让我害怕又必须坚持一辈子的事，我只能做十二小时。
只为了今天，我会变得快乐。亚伯拉罕·林肯说：“大多数人都和他们想象中一样高兴。”，这已经被证实了。
只为了今天，我会调整自我去适应，而不是调整一切来满足我的欲望。当幸运来临时，我会抓住它。
只为了今天，我会尽力加强我的大脑，我将学习。我将学习一些有用的东西。我将不会是一个精神上的拉人。我将读一些需要努力、思考和注意力集中的东西。
只为了今天，我将用三种方式锻炼我的灵魂。我将做对某人有利的事儿并且不被发现。如果有人发现了，那就不算。我将做至少两件我不想做的事——只为了锻炼。我将不会向任何人展示我的感觉受到伤害，他们也许受到伤害，但是今天我不会表现出来。
只为了今天，我将过的很惬意。我将尽我所能，穿着得体、讲话谦虚、行动优雅，一点不吹毛求疵，尽量改进和调节自己而不是别人。
只为了今天，我将制定一个计划，我也许不会严格的遵守它，但是我将拥有。我将避免两种错误：仓促行事和优柔寡断。
只为了今天，我将独自静静地呆上半个小时放松一下。在这半个小时里，有时，我将尽力对生活得到一个更好的看法。
只为了今天，我将不再害怕，尤其是不再害怕享受美丽的事物，相信我给予世界的，世界也将给予我。

If swallows go away, they will come back again. If willows wither, they will turn green again. If peach blossoms fade, they will flower again. But, tell me, you the wise, why should our days go by never to return? Perhaps they have been stolen by someone. But who could it be and where could he hide them? Perhaps they have just run away by themselves. But where could they be at the present moment?

I don't know how many days I am entitled to altogether, but my quota of then is undoubtedly wearing away. Counting up silently, I find that more than 8000 days have already slipped away through my fingers. Like a drop of water falling off a needle point into the ocean, my days are quietly dripping into the stream of time without leaving a trace. At the thought of this, sweat oozes from my forehead and tears trickle down my cheeks. 

What is gone is gone, what is to come keeps coming. How swift is the transition in between! When I get up in the morning, the slanting sun casts two or three squarish patches of light into my small room. The sun has feet too, edging away softly and stealthily. And, without knowing it, I am already caught in its revolution. Thus the day flows away through the sink when I wash my hands; vanishes in the rice bowl when I have my meal; passes away quietly before the fixed gaze of my eyes when I am lost in reverie. Aware of its fleeting presence, I reach out for it only to find it brushing past my outstretched hands. In the evening, when I lie on my bed, it nimbly strides over my body and flits past my feet. By the time when I open my eyes to meet the sun again, another day is already gone. I heave a sigh, my head buried in my hands. But, in the midst of my sighs, a new day is flashing past.

Living in this world with its fleeting days and teeming millions, what can I do but waver and wander and live a transient life? What have I been doing during the 8000 fleeting days except wavering and wandering? The bygone days, like wisps of smoke, have been dispersed by gentle winds, and, like thin mists, have been evaporated by the rising sun. What traces have I left behind? No, nothing, not even gossamer-like traces. I have come to this world stark naked, and in the twinkling of an eye, I am to go back as stark naked as ever. However, I am taking it very much to heart: why should I be made to pass through this world for nothing at all?

O you the wise, would you tell me please: why should our days go by never to return?

如果燕子离开，它们会再次回来。
如果柳树枯萎，它们会再次变绿。
如果桃花凋零，它们会再次开放。
但是，聪明的你请告诉我，我们的日子为什么一去不复返了呢？也许它们是被谁偷走了，但是他是谁呢？他又能把它们藏在哪里呢？也许是它们自己逃走了，但是，他们现在又在哪里呢？

我不知道我一共拥有多少日子，但是我的配额无疑是消耗殆尽了。默默地的数了数，我发现8000多天已经从我的指间溜走。就像针尖的一滴水掉入了大海，我的日子滴在了时间的河流中，没有留下一丝痕迹。想到这里，我的额头上渗出了汗水，眼泪顺着脸颊流了下来。

过去的已经过去，要来的终究回来。这中间的过度太快了！当我早上醒来的时候，斜射的阳光把两三个正方形的光投射到我的小房间里。太阳也有脚，轻轻地悄悄地溜走了。在不知不觉中，我已经陷入了革命之中。于是，洗手的时候，日子从水盆里溜走；当我吃饭时，消失在碗里；当我发呆时，从我凝视的目光下静静地离去。当我意思到它转瞬即逝的存在，我伸手去寻找它，缺发现它掠过伸出的双手。在晚上，当我躺在床上，它敏捷地跨过我的身体，掠过我的脚。当我睁开眼睛迎接塌秧的时候，又一天已经过去了。我叹了一口气，将我的头埋在双手中。但是，在我的叹息中，新的一天正在闪过。

生活在这个世界上，有着转瞬即逝的日子和无数的人，除了徘徊和彷徨，我还能做什么呢？在这8000个转瞬即逝的日志里，除了徘徊和彷徨我又做过什么呢？过去的日子，如轻烟，被微风吹散，像薄雾，被初升的太阳蒸发。我留下了什么痕迹？没有，什么都没有，甚至于连一条蛛丝般的痕迹都没有。我赤裸裸的来到这个世界，转眼间又将赤裸裸地回去了。然而，我很想知道：为什么要让我白白地走过这个世界？

噢！聪明的你，请告诉我：为什么我们的日子一去不复返呢？

It is almost a definition of a gentleman to say he is one who never inflicts pain. This description is both refined and, as far as it goes, accurate. He is mainly occupied in merely removing the obstacles which hinder the free and unembarassed action of those about him, and he concurs with their movements rather than takes the initiative himself.

His benefits may be considered as parallel to what are called comforts or conveniences in arrangements of a personal nature: like an easy chair or a good fire, which do their part in dispelling cold and fatigue, though nature provides both means of rest and animal heat without them.

#### 译文
绅士的定义大概就是说他从来不会带给他人痛苦。这种描述既精炼又准确。他的主要职责就是消除那些阻碍周围的人自如行动的障碍。而且他与其他人行动一致，而不是自己主动。

他的好处可以被认为是个人性格安排中所谓的舒适或方便，就像安乐椅或一场好火，它们在驱除寒冷和疲劳方面起到了作用，尽管大自然同时提供了休息的方法和动物的体温。

1. YOU DON’T OWE ANYONE AN EXPLANATION FOR YOUR LIVING SITUATION.
Whether you are cohabiting with your ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, crashing in different motel rooms across the country, or living with your parents for a while when you are past your twenties, you don’t have to explain yourself to anyone for who you live with and why if you don’t want to. If you are fully aware of your living situation, then it means you have your own reasons for being in that situation that are nobody else’s business.


2. YOU DON’T OWE ANYONE AN EXPLANATION FOR YOUR LIFE PRIORITIES.

You have your own ideas about the things that would make you and your loved ones truly comfortable and happy, which is your main priority. Since we are all unique individuals with different values, dreams and aspirations, your core priorities will be different from the next person’s. You don’t owe anyone an explanation for what you determine is your core priority in life. That is your personal business not other people’s business.

2.你不必给任何人解释你的生活重心。
让自己和自己爱人真正的感到舒适和高兴，你拥有自己的想法，这就是你的生活重心。因为我们都是独一无二的个体，拥有着不同的价值观，梦想以及愿望，你的生活重心也与他人不一样。你不必给任何人解释什么是你在生活重心的决定。那是你的私事，与他人无关。
